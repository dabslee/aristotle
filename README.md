A free, open-source learning management system (LMS) built on Python's Django framework. Uses Bootstrap v5.0 as a CSS template.

## Getting Started
To get started, just navigate to [aristotle.brandonssandbox.com](http://aristotle.brandonssandbox.com/) and press the "Sign Up" button to register! The webpage may take a few seconds to load initially--the website is deployed on a free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) plan, which means that 30 minutes of inactivity causes the website server to "sleep" for a bit.

Once you sign up once, you should be able to log in with your already created account in the future by pressing the "Log in" button.

## Demo/Example
If you're just checking this project out, you might not want to go through the whole process of creating an account, a course, and various assignments to check out this website's features. Fortunately, I've created a demo/example course, which you access as either the course owner/teacher or as a student. The login credentials for each are listed below:
> <b>Course owner</b><br>
> Username: `exCourseOwner`<br>
> Password: `expassword`

> <b>Student</b><br>
> Username: `exCourseStudent1`<br>
> Password: `expassword`

Just log in with one of the credentials above to explore our example course! The example course is called "Example Course - USACO Training" and adapts/references the primary training website for high school students studying for the computing olympiad, the [USACO training site](http://train.usaco.org/).
